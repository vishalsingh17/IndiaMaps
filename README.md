Website containing the non distorted maps of India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

We have often seen people intentionally or unintentionally using distorted maps of our motherland where sometimes the J&K and Ladakh region is cut out and shown as a part of Pakistan. On few occasions the state of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim are shown as part of China. 
These distorted maps are floating on almost all social media platforms and even on Google images. Hence, I came up with this website where I have uploaded the non distorted, accurate maps of India that can be used by anyone without worrying about the authenticity of the maps.
The maps are easily and freely downloadable.
